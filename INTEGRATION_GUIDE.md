# Local Swarm + Claude Code + LM Studio Integration Guide

This guide explains how to connect your **Local Swarm Assistant** (Web UI) with **Claude Code** (CLI) and **LM Studio**.

## 0. Prerequisites & Installation

### A. Install Node.js
Ensure you have Node.js (v18 or higher) installed to run the Proxy and the React App.
```powershell
node -v
```

### B. Install Claude Code (CLI)
If the official `install.ps1` script fails silently, install it directly via NPM:

```powershell
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

Once installed, authenticate with Anthropic:
```powershell
claude login
```

## 1. The Architecture
- **Web UI:** React app for visually managing the Swarm and orchestrating high-level planning.
- **Proxy Server (`proxy.js`):** The central nervous system. It bridges HTTP requests from the browser to your local file system.
- **`SWARM_CONTEXT.md`:** The "Shared Brain". The Swarm writes to this file, and Claude reads from it.

## 2. Startup Sequence
1. **Start LM Studio:** Load your model and start the Server (Port 1235).
2. **Start the Proxy:** 
   ```powershell
   node proxy.js
   ```
   *Note: This creates/resets `SWARM_CONTEXT.md`.*
3. **Start the Web UI:**
   ```powershell
   npm start
   ```

## 3. How to Use "Claude Code"
Once your Swarm has finished a discussion and the "QA Critic" has approved a plan (you will see "Plan Synced to Context" in the UI), the detailed plan is now inside `SWARM_CONTEXT.md`.

To instruct Claude to execute this plan, run the following command in your terminal (Cursor):

```powershell
claude "Read SWARM_CONTEXT.md. This file contains a detailed implementation plan generated by a swarm of AI agents. Please implement the steps outlined in the final plan, starting with Step 1."
```

## 4. Sending Messages Back to Swarm
If Claude needs to ask the Swarm a question, you can send a message back into the Web UI via the bridge using curl or a script:

```powershell
curl -X POST http://localhost:1234/bridge/cli/input -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"content": "I have finished Step 1. Please review the database schema in /server/models."}'
```
